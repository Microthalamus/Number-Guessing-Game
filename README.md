# Number-Guessing-Game
Small assignment for MS539 Programming Concepts course. Created to demonstrate understanding of GUI components and exception handling using C#.

This project features a number guessing game where the user thinks of a number between the values 1 and 10. Once this number has been determined, the user will then click the start button and the program will generate the first guess attempt in the textbox. The user then say whether the value is too high, too low, or if the program has guessed the right integer using the corresponding buttons. Clicking "No, it is lower" will prompt the program to generate a random number that is lower than the previous number. Vice versa, clicking "No, it is higher" will prompt the program to generate a random number that is higher than the previous number. Once the correct number is guessed and the user will click the "Yes" button which thanks the user for their participation and clears the textbox. The process can be repeated as many times as the user likes.
